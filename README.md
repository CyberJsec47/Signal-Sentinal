# Signal Sentinel
### Detecting Radio Jamming attacks through machine learning
#### Designed to work on small form embedded systems for remote and automated detection and response

---

## Project Goals:
 
- **Set up an RF testing area**
- **Extract statical values from raw IQ data**
- **Create a dataset of safe and jamming signals**
- **Train, Test and evaluate different ML models**
- **Develop a program to automatically capture and classsify signals**
